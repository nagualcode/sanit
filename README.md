#### Tell me more:

Sanit is a tool that will revolutionize the way you organize your files! With just one simple command, you can say goodbye to those pesky special characters that always seem to cause problems.

But wait, it gets even better. This program was specifically designed to handle huge amounts of files, so you can finally say goodbye to those long, tedious renaming sessions. And best of all, it's open source, so you can join the community of developers on Github and help make Sanit even better!

But don't just take my word for it - try it out for yourself and see the magic happen. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

Thanks for tuning in, and a special thanks to CS50 for giving me the will to try to code in C. So, what are you waiting for? Give Sanit a try and see the difference it can make in your file organization!
